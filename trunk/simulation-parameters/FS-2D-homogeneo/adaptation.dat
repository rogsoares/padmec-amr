Set error analisys and mesh adaptation parameters


Use mesh adaptation:
yes

Refinement Strategy: {h-refinement, remeshing}
remeshing

Error tolerance for all mesh elements:
0.2

Error tolerance for all mesh elements excluding those on singularities regions:
0.1

Maximum number of 2D element subdivisions (recommended: 4)
4

Maximum number of 3D element subdivisions (recommended: 3)
3

Maximum number of refinement steps:
2

Obs.: Error tolerance for all mesh elements must be greater than the tolerance excluding those on singularities regions:
      Singularities are critical because error are high than in other domain's parts.
